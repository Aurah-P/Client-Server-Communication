This project interfaces the two Raspberry Pi pico Ws connected to the local network
When connection is established, one can send and receive messages from the other but it has to happen one at a time
After sending a message, one has to wait until a message is received from the other
The button has been used to represent a keyboard in this case
This project is still in the planning phase and more developments are yet to come up
